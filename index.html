                            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages â€” every
                            time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at â€” displaying timely
                            content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. â€” you can bet that
                            JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which
                            (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

<h2>JavaScript data types and data structures</h2>
Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to another. This
article attempts to list the built-in data structures available in JavaScript and what properties they have. These can
be used to build other data structures. Wherever possible, comparisons with other languages are drawn.

<li>Dynamic typing</li>
JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic language. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any
particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

<code> let foo = 42;  // foo is now a number
foo = 'bar'; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
</code>

<li>Data and Structure types</li>
The latest ECMAScript standard defines nine types:

<li>Six Data Types that are primitives, checked by typeof operator:</li>
<code>
undefined : typeof instance === "undefined"
Boolean : typeof instance === "boolean"
Number : typeof instance === "number"
String : typeof instance === "string"
BigInt : typeof instance === "bigint"
Symbol : typeof instance === "symbol"
</code>

<li>Structural Types:</li>
<article>
    <p>Object : typeof instance === "object". Special non-data but Structural type for any constructed object instance also
used as data structures: new Object, new Array, new Map, new Set, new WeakMap, new WeakSet, new Date and almost
everything made with new keyword;</p>

<li> Function : </li>
 <p> a non-data structure, though it also answers for typeof operator: typeof instance === "function". This is
merely a special shorthand for Functions, though every Function constructor is derived from Object constructor.</p>

<li>Structural Root Primitive:</li>
typeof instance === "object". Special primitive type having additional usage for its value: if object is not
inherited, then null is shown;</p>

<p> Keep in mind the only valuable purpose of typeof operator usage is checking the Data Type. If we wish to check any
Structural Type derived from Object it is pointless to use typeof for that, as we will always receive "object". The
proper way to check what sort of Object we are using is the instanceof keyword. But even in that case there might be
misconceptions. </p>
</article>

<p>As we can see the meaning of every primitive type is obvious except of undefined and null which are almost the same.
This happens as the concept of Time is strictly connected with the purpose of algorithms. We can purport something that
does not yet exist or does not exist anymore: undefined. But when we wish to be able to represent something that exists
being empty, we have to invent another keyword. And that is what null stands for: the beginning of structural meaning.

            <h4> JavaScript Program To Print Hello World</h4>
            <p>In this example, you will learn to print 'Hello World' in JavaScript in three different ways.</p>
            <p>
            A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that prints Hello, World! on the screen. <br>Since it's a very simple program, this
            program is often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners.</p>
            
            <h4>We will use these three ways to print 'Hello, World!'. </h4>

            <code>
            console.log()
            alert()</code>
            <code>
            document.write()
            1. Using console.log()
            console.log() is used in debugging the code.
            </code>

            <h4>Source Code</h4>
            <code>
            // the hello world program
            console.log('Hello World');
            Output</code>
            
            <code>Hello, World!</code>
            
            <h4>Here, the first line is a comment.</h4>
            
           <code>// the hello world program </code>
            
           <h4>The second line</h4>

            <code>
            console.log('Hello, World!');
            prints the 'Hello, World!' string to the console.
            </code>
           
           <code>2. Using alert()
            The alert() method displays an alert box over the current window with the specified message.
            </code>

            <h4>Source Code</h4>
            <code>
            // the hello world program
            alert("Hello, World!");
            3. Using document.write()
            document.write() is used when you want to print the content to the HTML document.
            </code>
            Source Code
            <code>
            // the hello world program
            document.write('Hello, World!');
            </code>
